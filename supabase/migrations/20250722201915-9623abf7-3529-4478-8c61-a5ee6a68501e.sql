<p>If you''re a homeowner or property owner in Angelina County, Texas, and you think your property tax bill is too high — you''re not alone. Every year, thousands of Texans successfully protest their property tax assessments and save hundreds (sometimes thousands) of dollars.</p>

<p>In this post, we''ll walk you through exactly how to protest your property taxes in Angelina County, step by step, based on official county guidelines. Whether you''re a seasoned investor or a first-time homeowner, this guide will help you understand your rights and make sure you''re not overpaying.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Know Your Deadline</h2>

<p>The deadline to protest your property tax appraisal in Angelina County is usually <strong>May 15</strong>, or <strong>30 days after your Notice of Appraised Value is mailed</strong> — whichever is later.</p>

<p>Missed that deadline? You still might have a chance:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you didn''t receive a notice, you may be able to file up to the day before taxes become delinquent (typically February 1).</li>
<li>Or, within 125 days of receiving your tax bill, depending on the situation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don''t wait until the last minute — the earlier you file, the more time you have to build a strong case.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Try an Informal Review First</h2>

<p>Before you go through the formal hearing process, you can request an informal meeting with the Angelina County Appraisal District (CAD). This is often the easiest and fastest way to resolve issues like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Incorrect square footage</li>
<li>Property condition (e.g., foundation problems)</li>
<li>Data entry errors</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, the appraisal staff will agree to a reduction right then and there — no hearing required.</p>

<h2>Step 3: File Your Formal Protest</h2>

<p>If the informal route doesn''t work, it''s time to go formal. Here''s what to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fill out <strong>Form 50-132</strong> (Notice of Protest).</li>
<li>Submit it to Angelina CAD by the protest deadline.</li>
<li>If you''re having someone represent you (like a tax agent), you''ll also need to file <strong>Form 50-162</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can protest for a variety of reasons, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your home is appraised too high</li>
<li>It''s not appraised equally to similar properties</li>
<li>You were denied an exemption</li>
<li>Ownership or property details are wrong</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 4: Prepare for the ARB Hearing</h2>

<p>After your protest is filed, you''ll get a notice with the date and time of your hearing before the <strong>Appraisal Review Board (ARB)</strong> — a panel of local citizens who act as neutral decision-makers.</p>

<p>You''ll need to gather your evidence, which might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recent sales comps of similar homes</li>
<li>Photos of property damage or needed repairs</li>
<li>An independent appraisal</li>
<li>Contractor estimates</li>
<li>Tax history from past years</li>
</ul>

<p>You can attend the hearing in person, by phone, or submit a written affidavit if you can''t make it.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Attend the Hearing</h2>

<p>At the hearing, both you and the appraisal district will present your cases. The CAD must prove the value is correct based on the evidence. If you''ve provided an independent appraisal, they must meet a higher standard of proof ("clear and convincing evidence").</p>

<p>Hearings are usually short — 15 to 30 minutes — and fairly informal.</p>

<h2>Step 6: After the Decision</h2>

<p>You''ll receive the ARB''s decision in writing, typically by certified mail or email. If they agree with your protest, your property value will be reduced — and if you''ve already paid taxes, you may be entitled to a refund from the taxing units.</p>

<p>If you don''t agree with the result, you still have options. You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Appeal to <strong>District Court</strong></li>
<li>Request <strong>binding arbitration</strong> (must file within 45 days of the ARB order)</li>
<li>File with the <strong>State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH)</strong> if your property is valued over $1 million</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick Summary: Angelina County Property Tax Protest Steps</h2>

<ul>
<li>Check your protest deadline (May 15 or 30 days after notice)</li>
<li>Try an informal review with Angelina CAD</li>
<li>File Form 50-132 (and Form 50-162 if using an agent)</li>
<li>Prepare your evidence and attend the ARB hearing</li>
<li>Review the ARB decision — and appeal if necessary</li>
</ul>
